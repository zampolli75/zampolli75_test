# Scale Development  

- Items can be geenrated with a deductive or inductive approach.
- The deductive approach offers a better reliability since it is grounded and supported by the literature.
- Researchers should provide a clear link between the items and their theoretical domain.
- The minimum sample size for exploratory factor analysis is 150.
- The minimum sample size for confirmatory factor analysis is 200.
- The sample should be rapresentative of the population. For item groupings the use of students is deemed appropriate.
- It is important that the scale used generates sufficient variance among respondents for subsequent statistical analysis.
- Adequate internal consistency reliabilities can be obtained with as few as three items and adding items indefinitely makes progressively less impact on scale reliability.
- Negatively worded items create biases in the responses and reduce the correlation with other items that measure the same construct.
- Double-barreled statements would be split into two single-idea statements, and if that provd impossible the statement would be aliminated altogether.
- Factors with Eigenvalues grater than one is the most common criteria for factor retention. The Eigenvalues resulted from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- Items are typically retained with loadings of the items greater than .40. However, we could retain items with loadings as little as .30.
- Alpha values typically greater than .70 are adequate for use. Items that reduced alpha levels are usually eliminated.
- It is suggested to perform confirmatory analysis to obtain a better precision in evaluatin the measurement model.
- Scales should not be derived based on the results of factor analysis. Simply because items load on the same factor does not mean that they necessarily measure the same theoretical construct. Similarly, simply using internal consistency reliabilities for scale construction is not adequate.
- The most commonly accepted measure of reliability is the Cronbach's Alpha internal consistency reliability. Other measures are test-retest, interrater, and spli-half reliability.
- Reliability is a necessary pre-condition for validity.
- Assessign both stability and internal consistency is desirable. Alternative, it is sufficient the administration of the measure to an additional sample.
- Validity is generally assessed with factor analysis, internal consistency, and test-retet reliability. It can also be assessed through nomological network of relationships with other variables through criterion-related validity, assessing two groups that would be expected to differ on the measure, and the demostrating discriminant and convergent validity using a method such as the multitrait-multimethod matrix.
- Criterion-related validity is usually confirmed using either correlation or regression analysis.
- It is inappropriate to use the same sample both for scale development and for assessing construct validity. The use of an indipendent sample to provide an application of the measure in a substantive context will enhance the generalizability od the new measures.  
- It is reccomended that when items are added or deleted fro ma measure, the 'new' scale should then be administered to another independent sample.
- A measure may appear to be a valid index of some variable, but lack construct and/or criterion-related validity.
- A measure is valid when the differences in observed scores reflect trye differences on the characteristics one is attemping to measure and nothing else.
- A measure is reliable to the extent that independent but comparable measures of the same trait or construct of a given object agree. Reliability depends on how much of the variation in scores is attributable to random or chance errors. Reliability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for validity.
- Researchers should have good reasons for proposing additional *new* measures given the many available.
- If all items in a measure are drawn from the domain of a single construct, responses to those items should be highly intercorrelated.
- The square root of the coefficient alpha is the estimated correlation of the k-item test with errorless true scores. Thus a large alpha indicates that the k-item test correlates well with the true score.
- The basic problem with straight test-restest reliability is respondents' memories. They will tend to reply to an item the same way in a second administration as the did in the first. The high correlation of the total scores on the two tests would suggest the measure had small measurement error when in fact very little is demonstrated about validity by straight test-retest correlations.
- Any particular construct or trait should be measurable by at least two, and preferably more, different methods. Otherwise the researcher has no way of knowing whether the trait is anything but an artifact of the measurement procedure.
